Sorry I can not include this file because

In the file JdbcMetaData.java in package com.caucho.jdbc
in method public static JdbcMetaData create(DataSource ds),
you need to add

    if ("H2".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
        return new H2MetaData(ds);
    else

just before

    if ("oracle".equalsIgnoreCase(name))
